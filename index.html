        <h1>Present Value of Annuities Game</h1>
        <div id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The present value of an annuity is a crucial concept in finance that calculates the current value of a series of future payments, given a specified rate of return. There are two types of annuities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Annuity:</strong> Payments are made at the end of each period.</li>
                <li><strong>Annuity Due:</strong> Payments are made at the beginning of each period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these concepts is essential for business students as they form the foundation for many financial decisions, including investment analysis, loan calculations, and retirement planning. The present value of an annuity helps determine the lump sum amount needed today to fund a series of future payments, considering the time value of money.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
